# Chrome Tab Reader - Python Dependencies

# Optional: For proper XDG Base Directory Specification compliance on Linux
# and cross-platform config directory support
# If not installed, will fall back to manual implementation
platformdirs>=4.0.0

# Note: The HTTP server (chrome_tab_http_server.py) will work without
# platformdirs, but installing it is recommended for better compliance
# with system standards.
#
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
